Homework 1
Getting a Clear Visual of Data Visualization – Fall 2024
What to do:
• Pick at least two (2) exercises to complete from the list below
o You may complete any that are interesting or exciting to you. Though you may
select those which seem easiest, I hope you’ll challenge yourself by picking
some which align with your interests and help you build your skills.
• Submit one (1) pdf containing all of your answers to the exercises you’ve
completed to the assignment on Canvas by the end of day (11:59PM EDT) on
Friday, September 27th.
Exercise Set – Pick two (2) to complete:
• Attend office hours for one (1) of your classes (not this one).
They can be held by either the instructor or by a TA. After attending, write the
answers to the following questions:
o What class’s office hours did you attend?
o When did you go?
o Who did you talk to?
o What is one (1) thing that you talked about or learned from attending?
▪ Note: if you talked about something personal which you would prefer
not to share, you can write “We talked about something personal”
instead.
• Visit three (3) places that you might want to study or do homework on campus.
For one (1) of these places:
o Rate it on a scale from 1 to 5 stars (half stars are allowed)
o Write a 50 to 100 word Yelp-style review (about the length of this bullet
point). Don’t worry too much about adhering to a specific style and feel free
to bring your personality into the review. Ideally, after reading your review,
other students should be able to get a good feeling about whether that study
space is right for them (even if it’s not right for you).
• Create a Github account and make your first repository.
https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&s
ource=header-home
Then, answer the following questions:
o What is your github username?
o Provide a link to the repository you created.
o Use the git commands (add, commit, and push) in a terminal or a GUI-based
git program (like Github Desktop) to add a file of your choice to the repository.
For example, you could add this homework document.
• Watch a video about a great data visualization from this YouTube playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzq0eVw_4Dkqd5kuwY3uMANPvVBQ292V
After watching the video, answer the following questions:
o Which video did you watch?
o What is this video’s highlighted visualization about?
o What does Robert Kosara (the person speaking) argue that this visualization
does particularly well?
o What is one (1) lesson from this video that you can apply to the process of
making a data visualization?
• Create visualizations using the matplotlib package in python
Matplotlib Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp
Python Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp
Then, add screenshots of two (2) visualizations you created (e.g., scatter plot, bar
chart, pie chart, histogram, etc.) to your homework pdf.
Your visualizations should not be identical to any of the visualizations in the tutorial
and should include the following:
o Title
o Axis labels
o Data marks (e.g. line(s), dots, bars, pie slices, etc.)
